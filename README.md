## A full-stack e-commerce web application for pet owners who want to purchase pet goods.

As a cat owner and pet enthusiast, I understand the panic that arises when your petsâ€™ favorite products run out.

Browse through the curated selection of high-quality pet products and enjoy a seamless shopping journey.
